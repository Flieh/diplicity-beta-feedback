# diplicity-beta-feedback

Hi everyone,

We'll be collecting observations and bug reports here for Martin's Diplicity Android App. Please read issues and add your comments, it would be helpful if people added thumbs up to issues they deem important. Add issues for things not already discussed but let's try not to be too repetitive. Let us know about how you'd like to see things work. Give us your thoughts on organizing games, map and rule variants, community practices (harassment, banning, paywalls). Any thing you can think of.

I will work with Martin to bring him the best ideas. Keep in mind that it's a labor of love on his part, so he'll do what he wants ultimately. But he is interested in what the community has to say.

Here is a link that will allow you to [configure email notifications] (https://diplicity-engine.appspot.com/User/111874156655660979592/UserConfig)

Here is a link to [Martin's google drive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B67FlKHmCU84eWVnRy1tcVUtVlk) where all the apks are available. 

### Until further notice, everyone should be using Build 63
